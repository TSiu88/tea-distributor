  - [x] As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available teas. For each tea, I want to see its name, type, origin, flavor, price and an image.
  - [x] As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new tea to a list.
  - [x] As a user, I want to be able to click on a tea to see its detail page.
  - [x] As a user, I want to see how many tins are left for a tea (quantity).
  - [x] As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a tea whenever I sell a tin of it. This should decrease the number of tins left by 1. Tins should not be able to go below 0.

  - [ ] As a user, I want the option to edit a tea's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
  - [ ] As a user, I want to be able to delete a tea.
  - [x] As a user, I want a tea to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
  - [x] As a user, I want teas with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try some before it's gone!
  - [ ] As a user, I want to have teas prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of tins left.
  - [ ] As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!)
