## Specifications

### User Stories
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand to view User Stories </summary>

  - As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
  - As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
  - As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
  - As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
  - As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.

### Further Exploration

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand to viewFurther Exploration topics </summary>

  - [ ] As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
  - [ ] As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg.
  - [ ] As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
  - [ ] As a user, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone!
  - [ ] As a user, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of pints left.
  - [ ] As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!)
